Are your feet sliding around inside your tabi?<br/>
Are your tabi too tight, causing foot pain?<br/>
Are the ankle straps too loose, causing the fasteners to come undone while walking?<br/>
Are the ankle straps too tight, making it difficult to fasten them?<br/>
It is said that the proper way to wear tabi is without wrinkles, as this enhances the beauty of the kimono.<br/>
If you don’t wear tabi that fit your feet perfectly, not only will your traditional Japanese attire look less elegant, but you may also experience foot pain and find it difficult to walk for long periods.<br/>
The key to choosing tabi is ensuring they are comfortable to wear and make your feet appear smaller and more slender.<br/>
Please refer to the following instructions to select tabi that match your size and purpose.

### Material Selection (Outer Fabric)

There is a reason why cotton is used in tabi!<br/>
What is it?<br/>
While most kimonos and juban are made of pure silk, there is a significant difference in strength between silk and synthetic fibers like nylon.<br/>
When walking, the tabi and the hem of the kimono rub against each other, causing friction. Even with normal walking, the hem of the front and back panels can tear and become worn out. (Please be careful when wearing your precious kimono.)<br/>
Therefore, cotton tabi are recommended to avoid damaging the pure silk.

      types: "Cotton Tabi",
      features: `Cotton tabi come in various weaves such as calico, broadcloth, and satin. General white tabi use calico or broadcloth, while black tabi for men use satin weave. For formal occasions, white calico tabi are commonly worn. Even among calico, quality and price vary greatly! The white calico tabi recommended by 'Ebisu Tabi' use the highest quality fabric, treated with anti-shrinkage and anti-stain processes, making them smooth in appearance and texture, and resistant to yellowing.`
    },
    {
      types: "Stretch Tabi",
      features: `The third-generation owner of 'Ebisu Tabi' developed stretch cotton tabi for those unfamiliar with wearing tabi, inspired by the fabric of bras at the time. They collaborated with a major textile company to create a fabric (cotton mixed with polyurethane) for these stretch tabi, which are now the company's most popular product, suitable for formal occasions. Unlike the cheap stretch tabi commonly sold, these offer a completely different wearing experience and have many loyal customers. Recommended for tabi beginners or those with bunions. They are also comfortable for long periods of sitting seiza-style.`

    {
      types: "Hemp Tabi",
      features: `Made with pure hemp fabric on both sides, these tabi are characterized by their rough texture, excellent breathability, and refreshing feel. Suitable for everyday wear in summer. Previously, only 100% hemp tabi were made, but since 2015, tabi made with a blend of hemp and cotton have been added to the lineup.`

      types: "Pure Silk Tabi",
      features: `These tabi feature the unique luster and soft texture of pure silk. Used for special formal occasions like weddings. With the increasing trend of renting wedding attire, the only item the bride and groom can keep from what they wore on the day is likely the tabi they brought themselves. As the only memento of the day, please wear the formal habutae silk tabi.`

      types: "Nylon Tabi",

### Material Selection (Inner Fabric)

Tabi are available in all-season (bleached lining) and winter (flannel lining) types. Currently, all-season bleached lining is the mainstream, but before the war, the winter flannel lining type was more common. Just like with the outer fabric, the recommended products from 'Ebisu Tabi' use the highest quality fabric for both bleached and flannel linings.

### Tabi Styles

At 'Ebisu Tabi', we offer a variety of styles to suit different foot types: the 'Slim Fit' for those with slender feet, the 'Medium Fit' for average feet, the 'Relaxed Fit' for slightly wider feet, and the 'High Arch Fit' for those with higher insteps. Additionally, we have the 'Stretch Fit' and 'Stretch Relaxed Fit' for those who need flexibility, the 'Heel Insert Fit' for wearing with heels, and the 'Round Toe Fit' for priests and monks during ceremonies.

### Number of Fasteners

Fasteners refer to the metal clasps located on the side of the ankle. There are basically two types: 4-fastener and 5-fastener.

Nationally, the 4-fastener type is more common. However, in the Kansai region, the 5-fastener type is more prevalent due to the aesthetic preference of not exposing the skin of the ankle when wearing a kimono. In contrast, in the Kanto region, slightly exposing the skin is considered refined, making the 4-fastener type more common.

A difference of just one fastener results in a length difference of about 1.5 centimeters. Therefore, for those who prefer less tightness around the ankle, the 4-fastener type is recommended.

There is no official rule regarding the number of fasteners, but in tea ceremonies or dance events, instructors may set specific guidelines. Thus, it is advisable to inquire before making a purchase.

      description: `【2】 Use a measuring tape to wrap around the widest part of your foot, which is typically around the base of your big toe and little toe.

※ Please have someone else take the measurements for you (it is difficult to get accurate results by yourself).<br/>
※ After measuring, if you are purchasing cotton tabi, choose a size about 0.3 cm larger than your measurement. For stretchable tabi, choose a size about 0.5 cm larger. (Although anti-shrink treatment has been applied, the tabi may slightly shrink after washing.)
