Do your feet feel like they’re swimming inside your tabi?<br/>
Are your tabi too tight, causing pain in your feet?<br/>
Is the ankle part too loose, causing the fasteners to come undone while walking?<br/>
Is the ankle part too tight, forcing you to struggle with the fasteners?<br/>
It is said that the proper way to wear tabi is to ensure there are no wrinkles, as this enhances the beauty of kimono attire.<br/>
If you don’t wear tabi that fit your feet perfectly, not only will your traditional Japanese outfit look less elegant, but your feet may also hurt, making it difficult to walk for long periods.<br/>
The key to choosing tabi is to ensure they are comfortable to wear without stress and make your feet appear smaller and more slender.

Please refer to the instructions below to select the right tabi for your size and purpose.

### Material Selection (Outer Fabric)

There’s a reason why cotton is used for tabi!<br/>
What is it?<br/>
While many kimonos and juban are made of pure silk,<br/>
there is a significant difference in strength between silk and synthetic fibers like nylon.<br/>
When walking, the tabi rub against the hem of the kimono, causing friction. Even with normal walking, the hem of the kimono can tear and become tattered. (Please be careful when wearing your precious kimono.)<br/>
For this reason, cotton tabi are recommended to avoid damaging the pure silk.

      types: "Cotton Tabi",
      features: `Cotton tabi vary in weave, including calico, broadcloth, and satin. General white tabi use calico or broadcloth, while black tabi for men use satin. Calico white tabi are typically worn for formal occasions. Even within calico, quality and price vary widely! The white calico tabi recommended by 『Ebisu Tabi』 use the highest-grade fabric, treated with shrink-proof and stain-resistant finishes, making them smooth in appearance and texture, and resistant to yellowing.`
    },
    {
      types: "Stretch Tabi",
      features: `The third-generation owner of 『Ebisu Tabi』, aiming to create stretchable cotton tabi as an alternative to nylon tabi for those unfamiliar with wearing tabi, drew inspiration from bra fabrics and collaborated with a major textile company to develop a fabric (cotton blended with polyurethane). This stretch tabi, suitable for formal occasions, is our most popular product. Its comfort is entirely different from cheap stretch tabi on the market, earning it a loyal customer base. Recommended for beginners or those with bunions, it is also comfortable for long periods of seiza (sitting on the knees).`

    {
      types: "Hemp Tabi",
      features: `Made with pure hemp fabric on both the inside and outside. Its coarse texture allows for excellent breathability and a refreshing feel, making it ideal for everyday wear in summer.

### Material Selection (Inner Fabric)

Tabi are available in two types based on the inner fabric: all-season (bleached lining) and winter-specific (flannel lining). Currently, the all-season bleached lining is the mainstream choice, but before World War II, the winter-specific flannel lining was more common. Just like with the outer fabric, the recommended products from 『Ebisu Tabi』 use the highest-grade materials for both bleached and flannel linings.

### Styles of Tabi

『Ebisu Tabi』 offers a variety of styles to suit different foot types: the "Slim Fit" for those with narrow feet, the "Standard Fit" for average feet, the "Roomier Fit" for slightly wider feet, and the "High Instep Fit" for those with higher arches. Additionally, there are stretchable options like the "Stretch Fit" and "Stretch Roomier Fit," the "Heel-Compatible Fit" for those wearing heels, and the "Round-Toe Fit" designed for priests and monks for ceremonial use.

### Number of Fasteners (Kohaze)

Kohaze refers to the metal fasteners located on the side of the ankle, and there are two basic types: 4-fastener and 5-fastener tabi.

Nationally, 4-fastener tabi are more common. However, in the Kansai region, 5-fastener tabi are preferred due to the aesthetic of not exposing the ankle skin when wearing a kimono. In contrast, in the Kanto region, slightly revealing the skin is considered stylish, making 4-fastener tabi the norm.

The difference between 4 and 5 fasteners is about 1.5 centimeters in length, so for those who prefer less ankle tightness, we recommend 4-fastener tabi.

While there are no formal rules regarding the number of fasteners, tea ceremonies or dance events may have specific requirements set by instructors, so it’s advisable to inquire before purchasing.

※ Please have someone else measure for you. (It’s difficult to get accurate measurements on your own.)<br/>
※ After measuring, for cotton tabi, choose a size about 0.3 cm larger than your measurement; for stretch tabi, choose a size about 0.5 cm larger. (Although the tabi are pre-shrunk, they may shrink slightly after washing.)

※ For a convenient measuring method, refer to the tabi sizing chart (PNG file) below. Print it at actual size and use it for measurement.
