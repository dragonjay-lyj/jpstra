## The Comfort of Wearing Tabi

Tabi have a unique wearing experience. The comfort of putting on a pair of tabi that fits snugly and feels pleasant against the skin is comparable to the satisfaction of tying an obi, leaving one feeling refreshed and invigorated. This sensation is something that can never be replicated with ordinary socks. In fact, some people even choose to wear kimono just for the sake of wearing tabi. Moreover, tabi play a crucial role in enhancing the overall appearance of a kimono ensemble. They are not merely a part of undergarments; rather, in traditional Japanese attire, they can be considered an integral part of the kimono itself.

When it comes to men’s tabi, white tabi are typically reserved for formal occasions, while black or navy tabi are more common for everyday wear. But did you know that there is actually a much wider variety of tabi available? It’s absolutely not true that “all tabi are the same.” Simply changing the pair of tabi can completely transform the look of a kimono outfit, and more importantly, it can significantly alter one’s mood. Here, we will focus on introducing information about tabi that are generally available on the market, aside from the specialized tabi still used in the entertainment industry.

Why not try pairing your kimono or hakama with colorful tabi for a stylish touch!

## What Makes a Comfortable Tabi?

The definition of a comfortable tabi varies from person to person, so this is purely a matter of personal preference. However, in general, I believe it comes down to the following: "The material should be calico cotton, the lining should be bleached cotton, the number of hooks (kohaze) should be four, the size should be slightly smaller, and most importantly, it should fit the shape of your foot."

Ideally, the best option is to have a pair custom-made for you at a specialized tabi shop. However, when starting out, I recommend trying on ready-made tabi from various stores to find the pair that suits your preferences. Even if the size is the same, the fit can vary slightly between shops, and each pair has its own unique charm and comfort. Trying them on can be quite enjoyable.

Custom orders typically take at least a month, and in some cases, over six months to complete. This is because ensuring a proper fit requires multiple visits to the tabi shop for adjustments during the process. Unfortunately, renowned tabi shops seem to be concentrated in areas like Tokyo or Kyoto, and they are almost nonexistent in the local town where I live, making it difficult to find opportunities for custom orders.

For your reference, the price of ready-made tabi at a tabi shop is generally around 3,000 to 4,000 yen per pair. Custom-made tabi cost about 10% to 20% more than ready-made ones. The requirements for custom orders vary by shop, but most places accept orders starting from around ten pairs. While the price may be a bit steep, the comfort of tabi from any reputable shop is in a league of its own, so I highly recommend trying them at least once. At 3,000 yen per pair, it’s certainly not cheap, but if worn properly, they can last quite a long time. Considering the comfort they provide, I personally find them to be reasonably priced.

## About White Tabi

White Tabi (Left: Kyoto "Fundōya," Right: Asakusa "Meugaya")

In activities like kyudo (Japanese archery), white tabi are required as part of the uniform. However, when wearing regular kimono, white tabi are not typically worn on a daily basis. That said, there’s no rule against wearing them. Especially during the summer, white tabi can give a clean and cool appearance.

White tabi are the highest-ranking tabi, worn in extremely formal settings, such as with the first-class ceremonial attire (montsuki haori hakama). Conversely, wearing white tabi casually is considered the height of luxury. This is mainly because white tabi get dirty easily, and those who care about their appearance would need to change them multiple times a day. Additionally, appearing in public with dirty tabi is considered impolite, so people generally opt for colored tabi in daily life, as they require less maintenance.

Former Prime Minister Yoshida Shigeru, who was even called a kimono expert, was famous for wearing only white tabi and was nicknamed "White Tabi." In certain situations, white tabi may even exude a sense of dignity and grace. Indeed, pure white tabi naturally draw attention and stand out. Therefore, unless one has a particular preference for white tabi, in modern times, they can be reserved for formal occasions such as wearing a montsuki (kimono with one or more family crests), while colored tabi can be chosen for other occasions, even when wearing hakama.

## About Everyday Tabi

When it comes to everyday tabi, it’s often said that “in the Kanto region, dark blue calico tabi are customary, while in the Kansai region, black satin tabi are the norm.” These black satin tabi (pronounced “kurojusu” or “kuroshusu”), which have a glossy black finish, are perhaps the most popular tabi for men. However, I simply can’t bring myself to like them. The way the feet appear shiny black strikes me as more uncouth than elegant, and I find them particularly unsuitable when paired with hakama. Personally, I believe dark blue tabi are the best option in terms of color. They are versatile and can be paired with most kimono, except for very formal occasions. Although they are called “dark blue,” many, like the one in the photo on the left, appear almost black, but there is actually a wide variety of shades to choose from based on personal preference. With each wash, the color gains character and becomes more comfortable to wear, but it’s still best to wear a fresh pair when going out.

## About Colored Tabi

Even for men’s tabi, there are colored and patterned varieties. For men’s tabi, while black and dark blue tabi are considered the default colors, "colored tabi" usually refers to tabi in other colors. Strictly speaking, black and dark blue tabi are also colored tabi. Women’s tabi have long been available in a variety of colors, and men’s tabi have also become quite diverse in recent years. It’s important to note that colored tabi, for both men and women, are primarily for fashion purposes. Nowadays, there are more varieties of colored tabi than in the past, allowing for fun coordination with kimono and hakama colors. Some kimono shops recommend using colored tabi for a stylish look, but in reality, if you’re not careful with color matching, it can easily end up looking awkward. It’s not uncommon to choose a color based solely on the tabi, only to find it doesn’t quite match the kimono or hakama.

So, what kinds of colored tabi are available? There are brighter blues than dark navy, greens like warbler green, chestnut brown, dark tea, light tea, and gray tones, among others. Additionally, the color options vary significantly between shops. For example, while Kyoto’s "Fundōya" only offers iron navy, Tokyo’s Shin-Tomicho "Ōnoya" provides brighter blue-navy options, and Asakusa’s "Meugaya" has even lighter navy shades.

Tabi with soles in matching colors  In addition to navy and brown, there’s also mouse gray, and black soles are available  From left: light brown, azuki red, mouse gray, matcha green, navy, white

Moreover, tabi soles are no longer limited to white. There are navy or dark brown tabi with jet-black soles, navy tabi with pale blue-gray soles, mouse-gray tabi with light gray soles, and even tabi with soles in lighter shades of the same color. By the way, the black cotton tabi with black soles often worn by stagehands are colloquially called "crow tabi."

On the other hand, patterned tabi are mostly used for performances like dancing. There are striped cotton tabi, deep mugwort green with pine needle patterns, and indigo-dyed tabi with hemp leaf patterns, among a wide variety of options. Some tabi shops even allow customers to bring in their own kimono scraps to create custom tabi. However, it’s said that tabi made from kimono fabric don’t last very long.

## About Tabi Materials and More

Tabi are made from various materials such as cotton, linen, velvet, silk, and synthetic fibers, but cotton calico is the most common. Polyester tabi, which are inexpensive, are easy to care for but tend to be soft and may show the shape of the toes. Even today, leather tabi exist, though they are not very common, and I have never worn them myself. It’s said that leather tabi can become quite smelly after just one day of wear.

As for the inner lining of tabi, typically, unbleached cloth is used in summer, while flannel or similar linings are used in winter. However, even in the depths of winter, I wear tabi with unbleached linings. Flannel-lined tabi feel soft against the skin, but I find them a bit too bulky, so I rarely wear them. That said, flannel-lined tabi are favored by some, such as Noh actors, who wear them year-round for their moisture-absorbing properties and the soft, elegant lines they create.

When it comes to the number of hooks (kohaze), four is generally considered ideal. With three hooks, the skin around the ankle tends to show, which can be bothersome, while five hooks can make sitting uncomfortable and look a bit clumsy when wearing casual kimono. Nowadays, there are even tabi with six hooks, but ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference. The photo below shows a five-hook colored tabi from Asakusa’s "Meugaya" shop.

Fastening the Hooks

For sizing, it’s best to choose tabi that are the same size as your shoes or slightly smaller by 0.5 cm. Slightly snug tabi tend to wrinkle less and become more comfortable once you get used to them. However, forcing yourself to wear tabi that are too tight can cause them to wear out quickly and even hurt your feet, so it’s best to avoid this. (I speak from experience ^^;) While centimeters are now widely used for tabi sizing, many traditional tabi shops still use "mon" as a unit of measurement. By the way, the use of "mon" as a unit is a remnant of the practice of measuring length based on how many "mon" coins could be lined up side by side.

## Various Types of Tabi

Now, let’s take a look at some other types of tabi. These are all men’s tabi. By the way, I own all of them, but I hardly ever wear them. (^^;

Velvet Tabi: These were popular in the early Showa period, primarily for warmth. The soles are also made of velvet. Mainly for women, they were once seen in supermarket underwear sections, but now they are rarely found outside of specialized tabi shops. They come in a variety of colors.

Hemp Tabi: Fashionable tabi for summer. Made of 100% hemp, they are lightweight and cool in the summer, but they wrinkle easily and the shape of the toes is clearly visible, making them difficult to wear well. It’s important to choose a size that fits perfectly, even more so than cotton tabi. Brands like Fukusuke also produce them.

Stretch Tabi: Made of nylon, these are stretchable tabi. The material is so soft that the metal clasps can press against the foot and cause discomfort, and the shape of the toes is also easily visible. However, they are easy to care for as they can be dried directly after washing.

Unsai Tabi: These are thick, durable cotton tabi with sturdy soles, often worn by craftsmen during winter. The ones in the photo are made by Fukusuke, and the soles use a thick cotton fabric called "stone sole." By the way, tabi soles generally come in three types: the "Unsai (Unzai) sole," which has diagonal stripes on the surface; the "cedar sole," which has a W-shaped pattern; and the "stone sole," which has a rough surface. Additionally, in the Kansai region, the "cedar sole" is commonly used, while in the Kanto region, the "Unzai sole" is more typical.

## About Tabi Care

When washing tabi, you can put them in a laundry net and wash them directly in the washing machine without any issues. However, new colored tabi may fade, so caution is needed. Dark blue tabi, in particular, seem to fade more easily. When drying, gently pat the top and sole areas to smooth out the wrinkles before hanging them up. It’s a good idea to hang tabi directly on a modified wire hanger. If using clothespins, always clip the edge where the hook thread is attached. This way, even if there are marks from the clothespins, they won’t be noticeable. By the way, tabi can lose their shape, so it’s better not to hang them inside out. Once dry, avoid using an iron; instead, wear them to let your foot shape naturally smooth out the wrinkles. Ironing can cause a shiny finish.

Additionally, new tabi often have starch, so it’s best to wash them once to remove the starch before wearing, as this helps them conform better to your feet. If washing seems troublesome, you can simply wear the new tabi and take a bath in them. It’s worth noting that tabi that have been washed and worn multiple times feel more comfortable than new ones. As a result, I often can’t bring myself to throw away tabi that are worn out but well-fitted, and I use them as indoor slippers instead. By the way, in my case, the area around the base of the little toe tends to wear out and tear. If the tabi are too tight, the toes or sides of the feet are more prone to rubbing and tearing. Ultimately, the parts that are prone to friction or under constant pressure are more likely to tear, depending on how the tabi are worn. Of course, I continue to wear tabi as long as they can be repaired, but in the end, they are consumables, much like undergarments, and should be treated as such.

If wearing a hadajuban (undergarment) or susoyoke (apron), these should be put on after the tabi. Wearing tabi last may cause the clothing to become disheveled. Therefore, it is recommended to wear tabi before putting on a nagajuban (long undergarment).
                  When wearing tabi, as shown on the left, stand on one foot while slightly crouching to put on the tabi. Sitting cross-legged while wearing tabi is not considered the correct traditional posture.`

      description: `When fastening the hooks on tabi, always start from the bottom and work your way up, attaching them to the strings. There are always two strings, but when attaching the hooks, the inner string is a spare. The correct position is to attach the hooks to the outer string, and this will give you the accurate size. When selecting the size of your tabi, always ensure the hooks are attached to the outer string. If the hooks are difficult to fasten, try grabbing your ankle and twisting it outward or inward to make it easier. By the way, when removing tabi, you can take them off freely.`
