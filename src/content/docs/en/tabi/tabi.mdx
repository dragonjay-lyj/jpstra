## The Comfort of Wearing Tabi

Tabi socks offer a unique wearing experience. The comfort of wearing well-fitted, skin-friendly tabi is comparable to the satisfaction of tying an obi, and it can instantly uplift one's mood. This sensation is something that regular socks can never provide. Some people even choose to wear kimono just for the sake of putting on tabi.

Moreover, tabi play a crucial role in enhancing the overall appearance of traditional Japanese attire. They are not merely undergarments but rather an integral part of the kimono ensemble.

When it comes to men's tabi, white tabi are typically reserved for formal occasions, while black or navy tabi are more common for everyday wear. However, did you know that there is a much wider variety of tabi available? It's far from true that 'all tabi are the same.' Simply changing the type of tabi can dramatically alter the look of traditional attire and, more importantly, completely change your mood. Here, we will focus on introducing tabi that are generally available, excluding those special tabi still used in the entertainment industry.

Why not try pairing your kimono or hakama with colorful tabi for a stylish look!

The tabi from Asakusa's 'Meugaya' are Fukusuke-made colored tabi.

## What Makes a Comfortable Tabi?

The definition of a comfortable tabi varies from person to person, so this is purely a matter of personal preference. However, in general, I believe the following characteristics make for a good pair: 'Made from calico cotton, lined with bleached fabric, featuring four hooks (kohaze), slightly smaller in size, and, most importantly, tailored to fit the shape of your foot.'

Ideally, the best option is to have a pair custom-made at a specialized tabi shop. However, for beginners, it’s a good idea to try on ready-made tabi from various stores to find what suits your taste. Even the same size can vary slightly between shops, and each has its own unique charm and feel, making the process of trying them on quite enjoyable.

Custom orders can take as little as a month or as long as six months or more. This is because properly customizing tabi requires frequent visits to the shop to check the fit during the process. Unfortunately, traditional tabi shops, often referred to as 'old establishments,' are mostly concentrated in Tokyo or Kyoto, and are rarely found in local towns like where I live, making it difficult to get custom-made tabi.

For reference, the price of ready-made tabi at a tabi shop is generally around 3,000 to 4,000 yen per pair. Custom-made tabi typically cost 10% to 20% more than ready-made ones. While the minimum order varies by shop, most accept orders starting from around ten pairs. Although the price may seem steep, the comfort of tabi from these shops is in a league of its own, so I highly recommend trying them at least once. While 3,000 yen per pair may not be cheap, they can last quite a long time if worn properly, and considering the comfort, I personally find it to be a reasonable investment.

In activities like kyudo (Japanese archery), white tabi are often required as part of the uniform. However, when wearing kimono casually, white tabi are not typically worn, though there is no rule against it. Particularly in summer, white tabi can give a clean and cool appearance.

White tabi are considered the most formal and highest-ranking tabi, worn in extremely formal settings such as the first-class attire (black montsuki haori hakama). Conversely, wearing white tabi casually is often seen as the height of luxury. This is likely because they get dirty easily, and fashion-conscious individuals may need to change them multiple times a day. Additionally, appearing in public with dirty tabi is considered impolite, which is why colored tabi, which require less maintenance, are generally preferred for everyday wear.

Former Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida, who was known as a master of kimono, famously wore only white tabi and was even nicknamed 'White Tabi.' In certain situations, white tabi may exude a sense of dignity and elegance. Indeed, the pure white of tabi naturally draws attention and makes a striking impression. Unless one is particularly particular about wearing white tabi, in modern times, it might be best to reserve them for formal occasions such as wearing a montsuki (kimono with family crests) with one crest or more, and otherwise choose colored tabi with hakama based on personal preference.

## About Everyday Tabi

When it comes to everyday tabi, there’s an old saying: 'In the Kanto region, it’s indigo calico; in the Kansai region, it’s black satin.' This black satin tabi (called 'kurojusu' or 'kuroshusu'), with its glossy black finish, is perhaps the most popular type of tabi for men. However, I’ve never been able to warm up to it. The shiny black appearance at the feet strikes me as more unsophisticated than elegant, and I find it particularly unsuitable when wearing hakama. Personally, I think indigo tabi are the best. They’re versatile and can be worn in almost any casual setting, pairing well with most kimono. Although referred to as indigo, many are actually close to black, like the ones in the photo on the left, but there’s a wide variety of shades to choose from based on preference. With each wash, the color develops a unique character, and the comfort improves, but it’s still best to wear newer pairs when going out.

Indigo Tabi / Black Tabi (Black Satin)

## About Colored Tabi

Men’s tabi also come in colored and patterned varieties. While black and indigo tabi are considered default colors for men, 'colored tabi' usually refers to other shades. Technically, black and indigo tabi are also colored tabi. Women’s tabi have long been available in a variety of colors, and men’s tabi have also become more diverse in recent years. However, colored tabi are strictly for fashion purposes for both men and women. Nowadays, there are more options than in the past, allowing for fun coordination with kimono and hakama. Some kimono shops recommend using colored tabi for style, but one must be very careful with color matching—poor coordination can easily look awkward. It’s common to choose a tabi color that seems fine on its own but clashes when paired with a kimono or hakama.

So, what colors are available? There are shades like lighter indigo, green tones such as warbler green, and browns ranging from chestnut to dark and light tea colors, as well as grays. The exact shades vary significantly between shops. For example, Kyoto’s 'Fundoya' offers only iron indigo, while Tokyo’s 'Ohnoya' in Shintomicho has brighter indigo options, and Asakusa’s 'Meugaya' offers even lighter shades.

Colored Tabi from Tokyo’s 'Ohnoya' / Kyoto’s 'Fundoya' / Fukusuke Brand’s Colored and White Tabi

Some tabi feature soles in matching colors. In addition to indigo and brown, there are also gray options, and some allow you to choose black soles. From left: light brown, red bean, gray, matcha green, indigo, and white.

Moreover, tabi soles are no longer limited to white. For example, dark brown or indigo tabi may have black soles, indigo tabi might have light bluish-gray soles, and gray tabi could have light gray soles. Incidentally, black tabi with black soles, often worn by stagehands, are sometimes called 'crow tabi.'

As for patterned tabi, most are for stage performances, such as dancing. However, there are many varieties, including striped cotton tabi, deep mugwort green with pine needle patterns, and indigo with hemp leaf designs. Some tabi shops even allow customers to bring in fabric scraps from their kimono to create custom tabi. However, tabi made from kimono fabric reportedly don’t last as long.

## About Tabi Materials and Other Details

Tabi are made from various materials, including cotton, linen, velvet, silk, and synthetic fibers, but cotton calico is the most common. Polyester tabi, which are inexpensive, are easy to handle but tend to be soft and reveal the shape of the toes. Leather tabi still exist but are not very common, and I’ve never worn them myself. Apparently, leather tabi can become quite smelly after a day of wear.

As for the lining, unbleached cotton is typically used for summer tabi, while flannel-lined tabi are for winter. Personally, I wear unbleached-lined tabi even in the coldest months. Flannel-lined tabi feel soft but are too bulky for my taste. However, some people, such as Noh actors, wear flannel-lined tabi year-round because they absorb moisture and create a softer silhouette.

The number of fasteners (kohaze) is best at four. Three fasteners tend to expose the ankle skin, which can be bothersome, while five fasteners make sitting difficult and can look awkward with casual kimono. Modern tabi even come with six fasteners, but ultimately, it’s a matter of personal preference. The photo below shows a five-fastener colored tabi from Asakusa’s 'Meugaya.'

Fastening the Kohaze

For sizing, choose the same size as your shoes or 0.5 cm smaller. Slightly snug tabi show fewer wrinkles and become more comfortable with wear. However, wearing overly tight tabi can cause them to wear out quickly and may hurt your feet. (I speak from experience ^^;) While centimeters are widely used today, many traditional tabi shops still use the 'mon' unit, a remnant of measuring length based on how many old coins (mon) could fit in a row.

## Various Types of Tabi

Now, let’s take a look at some other types of tabi. All of these are for men. By the way, I own all of them, but I hardly ever wear them. (^^;

Velvet Tabi: Popular in the early Showa era, these were primarily used for warmth. The soles are also made of velvet. Originally designed for women, they were once seen in supermarket lingerie sections but are now rarely found outside specialized tabi shops. They come in a variety of colors.

Hemp Tabi: Fashionable summer tabi made from 100% hemp. Light and cool in hot weather, but they wrinkle easily and clearly show the shape of the toes, making them challenging to wear. It’s essential to get the right size. Brands like Fukusuke also offer them.

Stretch Tabi: Made from nylon, these stretchable tabi are very soft—so much so that the metal fasteners (kohaze) can press painfully against the foot. They also reveal the shape of the toes. However, they are easy to handle as they can be dried directly after washing.

Unsai Tabi: Thick, durable cotton tabi for both the exterior and sole, often worn by craftsmen in winter. The photo shows a Fukusuke product with a sole made of thick cotton called 'stone sole.' Generally, tabi soles come in three types: 'Unsai' (diagonal stripes), 'Sugi' (W-pattern weave), and 'Ishi' (rough surface). In Kansai, 'Sugi' soles are common, while in Kanto, 'Unsai' soles are the norm.

Fukusuke’s Unsai Tabi. Looks like indigo tabi but made of thick fabric. Stone sole.

## Caring for Tabi

When washing tabi, it’s perfectly fine to put them in a laundry net and wash them directly in the machine. However, new colored tabi may bleed, so caution is needed. Indigo tabi, in particular, tend to bleed easily. When drying, stretch out the wrinkles by tapping the top and sole before hanging them. It’s best to hang them directly on a modified wire hanger. If using clothespins, always clip the edge where the fastener thread is attached, as any marks left here won’t be noticeable. Avoid drying tabi inside out, as they may lose their shape. Once dry, instead of ironing, wear them to smooth out the wrinkles with your feet. Ironing can cause a shiny finish.

New tabi often have starch, so washing them once to remove the starch helps them mold better to your feet. If washing is too much trouble, you can wear the new tabi while bathing. Incidentally, tabi that have been washed and worn multiple times are more comfortable than new ones. I often find it hard to throw away well-worn tabi because they fit so well, so I use them as indoor slippers. In my case, the area near the base of the little toe tends to wear out first. If the tabi are too tight, the toes or sides of the feet may rub and tear easily. Ultimately, the areas that experience the most friction or pressure are prone to wear. While I mend and wear them as long as possible, tabi are, after all, consumable items like undergarments.
