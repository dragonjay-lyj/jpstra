## The Image and Practicality of Fundoshi

What kind of impression does the word 'fundoshi' evoke for you? 'Erotic,' 'embarrassing,' or 'old-fashioned'—these are likely the common associations. It’s undeniable that fundoshi doesn’t carry a particularly positive image as underwear. However, these perceptions are purely based on its appearance and do not address its functionality as an undergarment. In fact, the history of Japanese people no longer using fundoshi as everyday underwear is relatively short. We Japanese are accustomed to seeing fundoshi as part of traditional festival attire or the mawashi worn by sumo wrestlers (a type of fundoshi). Once accepted, it doesn’t seem so unusual. The key is that if more people adopt fundoshi and it regains its 'citizenship' as underwear, it will no longer be seen as strange. In this sense, fundoshi shares a similar struggle with the kimono.

Thankfully, in recent years, the internet has seen the emergence of many serious websites dedicated to fundoshi, indicating that there are more people interested in it than one might think. Surprisingly, the age group of these enthusiasts tends to be quite young, with 20 to 30-year-olds forming the core.

What makes fundoshi exceptional is its functionality and comfort. Recent medical studies have even begun to prove its superiority as an undergarment. I have personally used the six-shaku fundoshi (a long type of fundoshi) as underwear for kimono for many years and firmly believe it is the perfect match for traditional Japanese clothing.

I still remember a New Year’s Eve program on NHK’s 'Year in Review' in the mid-1970s, which predicted that fundoshi would disappear from Japan by the 21st century. However, this prediction turned out to be completely wrong. Even today, in the 21st century, there are still many fundoshi enthusiasts. I encourage everyone to try fundoshi out of curiosity and experience its functionality and comfort for themselves.

## The Merits of Fundoshi

To put it simply, fundoshi can be described as underwear well-suited to Japan’s humid climate. However, its true value lies in its unique functionality and comfort, which are unmatched by other types of underwear. Since different types of fundoshi have distinct characteristics, I’d like to focus on the two most common and practical varieties: the 'rokushaku fundoshi' and the 'etchū fundoshi'.

Both types share several advantages as underwear. First, they allow for adjustable tightness based on one’s body type and preference. Second, they offer a distinctive sense of openness and breathability. Wearing breathable underwear is also beneficial for health. The secret to their breathability lies not only in their design but also in their material, which is typically bleached cotton (though silk and linen fundoshi also exist). Even among cotton fabrics, bleached cotton used for fundoshi differs from the cotton in briefs or boxers—it has a smooth texture that becomes softer and more skin-friendly with each wash, making it an ideal material for underwear. This is further evidenced by the fact that bleached cotton is also used for baby diapers. I sincerely hope that more people will take a serious look at fundoshi and discover the unique comfort it offers to men.

## About the Rokushaku Fundoshi

For those who favor the rokushaku fundoshi, its appeal undoubtedly lies in the way it feels when worn. The snug fit provides an indescribable sense of refreshment and sharpens one’s focus. The phrase ‘kin fundoshi ichiban’ (literally, ‘tight fundoshi, number one’) originates from this very sensation, and this comfort has a profoundly positive impact on one’s mental state. Additionally, depending on how tightly it’s tied, the horizontal wrap gently compresses the lower abdomen, which can even improve the functioning of internal organs. While this may be a matter of personal preference, the fact that the buttocks are mostly exposed creates a liberating feeling that, once experienced, can become addictive. Moreover, even when sweating, there’s no discomfort of fabric sticking to the skin, making it highly recommended for those who sit for long periods or struggle with heat rash. When wearing a silk nagajuban (undergarment), you can truly feel the smooth texture of the silk against your entire buttocks—an experience absolutely worth trying!

Furthermore, when wearing the rokushaku fundoshi with a kimono and an obi (sash), the horizontal wrap and the knot at the back, called the ‘mitsu,’ sit perfectly beneath the obi, providing stability. For those who only need minor adjustments, using a longer rokushaku fundoshi to thicken the horizontal wrap can offer better comfort than using a towel for adjustments. Even when using the restroom (for larger needs), there’s no need to pull it down completely like with briefs, and afterward, the obi won’t get in the way or cause the outfit to become disheveled, making the fundoshi far more convenient to manage.

## About the Length of the Rokushaku Fundoshi

First of all, the 'rokushaku' (six shaku) in rokushaku fundoshi does not refer to the unit used in construction or other fields, but rather to the kujirajaku (鯨尺: named after the whale baleen used to make rulers in ancient times) used in kimono tailoring. Therefore, six shaku equals approximately 227 cm. However, depending on body type, it may be necessary to make it slightly longer. For example, when tying an obi (sash), for someone with a waist size of about 90 cm, a length of around 270 cm is usually required. Of course, depending on the purpose of the fundoshi, the length of the fabric and the way it is tied can vary. In local festivals, sometimes a full tan (a unit of fabric length) is used as is, but for daily use as underwear, a length of around 200 cm is sufficient for practical purposes.

The shortest fabric on the far left is about 210 cm. Depending on body type, a minimum of 200 cm is needed to tie a rokushaku fundoshi properly. I mainly use this length for wearing under sleepwear or during the hot summer months. The red fundoshi in the middle is about 270 cm (approximately seven shaku), which is the most common length. This seven-shaku length is also widely used in festival settings. By the way, I don’t usually wear this red fundoshi; I mostly use white ones. The longest fundoshi on the far right is about 375 cm (approximately ten shaku). This is typically used when I want to wear a kimono more formally. It might be too long for everyday use.

## The Names of the Parts of the Rokushaku Fundoshi

The cloth hanging down at the front is called the 'maedare' (前垂れ).<br/>
Hidden beneath the maedare, the part of the cloth covering the crotch is called the 'fukuro' (袋).<br/>
The knot where the cloth crosses in a T-shape at the back is called the 'mitsu' (みつ).<br/>
The belt-like part wrapped around the waist is called the 'yokomawashi' (横廻し).<br/>
The vertical part running from the crotch at the back to the 'mitsu' on the back is called the 'tatemawashi' (立て廻し).

# How to Tie a Rokushaku Fundoshi

The rokushaku fundoshi is a long piece of cloth wrapped around the waist, and there are actually many ways to tie it. The method introduced here is merely an example of a daily style suitable as underwear for kimono, and it differs from the methods used during festivals or swimming, which involve more vigorous movements. (For professional tying methods used during festivals, please refer to other websites for detailed instructions). For example, the tying method for festivals or swimming ensures that it does not loosen even with intense physical activity, but using this method in daily life can be inconvenient when going to the restroom.

My usual tying method is similar to the Etchū fundoshi, with a front flap (maedare) and a single layer of cloth at the crotch (hitoe). This way, I can use the restroom without having to untie the fundoshi, and even if I sweat a little, it dries quickly, which I find hygienic.

Additionally, by adjusting the length of the cloth to suit your body type and preferences, you can create variations of the front flap style alone. Please try different methods according to the season, purpose, and your preferences. I usually tie it using the full width of the cloth (the original width of the tanmono), but some people cut the cloth vertically to 2/3 or 1/2 of its width for a narrower fit, so feel free to experiment.

Front flap single layer, waist wrap single layer (short length rokushaku)… approximately 6 shaku (227 cm) required<br/>
Front flap double layer, waist wrap single layer (medium length rokushaku)… approximately 7 shaku (265 cm) required<br/>
Front flap single layer, waist wrap double layer (slightly long rokushaku)… approximately 8 shaku (302 cm) required<br/>
Front flap double layer, waist wrap double layer (long length rokushaku)… approximately 10 shaku (378 cm) required

Please note that the tying method introduced here is just one example and not necessarily the most correct way. However, most methods for tying a rokushaku fundoshi are similar up to a certain point, with differences mainly in the knotting and handling of excess fabric. Once you get the hang of it, feel free to experiment with your own variations.

How to Tie a Rokushaku Fundoshi (Medium/Long Length Edition)… (An example using medium or long lengths of cloth)

One thing to note when tying a rokushaku fundoshi is that after wearing it for many years, dark marks may appear on both sides of the waist where the waist wrap (yokomawashi) presses against the skin, and these marks may not fade. In my case, perhaps due to loose skin, even after removing the fundoshi, the marked areas remain indented. While these marks are not painful, those who are particularly concerned might find the Etchū fundoshi a safer option.

## Materials for Rokushaku Fundoshi (Fabric)

While rokushaku fundoshi products are available through online shopping, you can essentially make your own fundoshi using fabrics like bleached cotton. All you need is a roll of bleached cotton fabric, cut to a length that suits your body size. For a rokushaku fundoshi, you can simply cut it to size without sewing, or you may choose to sew one end. For an Etchū fundoshi, prepare a piece of fabric about 100 cm long, attach a thick cord to one end, and sew the edge. Bleached cotton is the most commonly used fabric. You can find rolls of fabric (about 10 meters) for around 800 yen at kimono shops or baby sections of department stores. During sales, you might find them for around 300 yen per roll.

However, for a rokushaku fundoshi, a type of cotton fabric called 'moss' (モス) is the best choice. Moss is typically a roll of cotton fabric about 21 meters long and 35 cm wide, also a type of bleached fabric. It has a tighter weave and finer texture than regular bleached cotton, making it ideal for fundoshi, in my opinion. It feels significantly better than regular bleached fabric. A roll of moss costs around 1,500 to 2,500 yen, depending on the store, and white and red are relatively easy to find. Moss comes in about 20 colors, and some stores sell it by the cut. However, there are many varieties of bleached fabric and moss, so it might be difficult to find the perfect one on your first try. Since it’s relatively inexpensive, it’s worth experimenting. For rokushaku fundoshi, fabric rolls with 'ears'—a treatment to prevent fraying—are suitable. Moss is broadly categorized into thick and thin types, with thin types usually being cheaper and lower quality. Thick moss is about twice as thick as thin moss (for the same length of fabric).

Among shops that sell fabric for rokushaku fundoshi, my favorite is 'Adachiya' on Hisago Street in Asakusa. This store specializes in festival supplies and sells fabric for 'shimekomi' (what they call fundoshi here), with dozens of varieties available. The fabric at 'Adachiya' has an excellent texture and feel, and it’s worth noting that both edges of the fabric are treated with 'ears' to prevent fraying. Without this treatment, the threads tend to fray after each wash. Most commercially available fabrics have 'ears' on one side (some have none, so be careful). When buying here, you can confidently ask, 'Please cut seven shaku and ten shaku for me,' and they’ll happily oblige. If asked, 'What is this for?' I reply, 'It’s for shimekomi.' (This interaction might not work at other stores, so be careful!). The Etchū fundoshi sold here is also highly praised for being easy to wear.

Another recommended store is 'Yuzawaya' near JR Kamata Station, which carries a wide variety of bleached fabric and moss. They also sell by the cut. If you live near Tokyo, it’s worth checking out. For both bleached fabric and moss, it’s best to wash and thoroughly knead new fabric to improve its feel. Note that colored moss, like red or navy, will inevitably fade. Personally, I mainly use white.

By the way, at general kimono shops or wholesalers, you might need to refer to moss as 'Nice Moss' or 'A Nice' to be understood. Among commercially available thick moss, I’ve tried brands like 'Diamond Moss' and 'Kin Daikoku Moss,' and for thin moss, 'Ginban Izumi Kōbai Moss.' 'Kin Daikoku Moss' and 'Izumi Kōbai Moss' had a decent feel, but 'Diamond Moss' was slightly less comfortable for me. Interestingly, the red 'Diamond Moss' felt better than the white.

As for bleached cotton, the brand 'Shirataki Sarashi' is excellent in my experience. It has a good texture, becomes softer with each wash, and enhances the cotton’s natural feel. On the other hand, 'Chita Yuki Sarashi' remained stiff even after washing and didn’t seem suitable for fundoshi. However, after washing more than 20 times, the texture of these bleached fabrics changes significantly, so it’s hard to generalize. 'Shirataki Sarashi' is mainly available in the Kansai region, while 'Chita Yuki Sarashi' is found in the Kanto region. There are many other brands nationwide, so it’s best to start with what’s available locally. Personally, I use thin moss or bleached cotton in summer and thick moss in other seasons.

Besides cotton, there are also silk fundoshi. Silk is good for the body and feels amazing, but it’s expensive and hard to come by. Some are made from habutae or rinzu, and there are even chirimen fundoshi (see the Etchū fundoshi image at the bottom of this page). For silk fabric used as rokushaku fundoshi, slightly thick and sturdy material is suitable. Among my collection, I particularly like a silk rokushaku made from nagajuban fabric, which I use occasionally for a change of pace.

The photos above show fabric for rokushaku fundoshi. The fabrics in the leftmost photo are all cotton shimekomi fabric purchased from 'Adachiya' in Asakusa, with prices ranging from 80 to 300 yen per shaku depending on the pattern. I mainly use the white fabric at 110 yen per shaku on the far left. The middle photo shows moss fabric rolls available at kimono shops. The rightmost photo features two brands of bleached fabric and pure silk fabric. This silk fabric isn’t specifically for fundoshi, but it’s a recommended product for easily experiencing the feel of silk. It’s called 'dōura,' used as lining for women’s kimonos, and can be purchased for around 3,000 yen per roll (about 8 meters) during kimono sales at department stores. However, since it’s very thin, it’s best to use it double-layered, though the feel isn’t particularly great. It might be more suitable as a thin summer Etchū fundoshi with cords attached.

## Etchū Fundoshi

Due to personal preference, I wear the rokushaku fundoshi year-round, but the Etchū fundoshi with cords might be more popular. The Etchū fundoshi is typically worn as underwear for sleepwear or work clothes. Its advantages include the ability to freely adjust the tightness of the cords and the fact that it doesn’t compress the groin, providing a very relaxed fit. As a result, the Etchū fundoshi has gained attention as a stress-free undergarment. There are stories of people who couldn’t conceive for years succeeding after switching to the Etchū fundoshi, or others who relieved their shoulder stiffness. Personally, I find that the Etchū fundoshi doesn’t give me the same mental sharpness, so I prefer the rokushaku fundoshi. However, if you’re hesitant about the rokushaku, the Etchū fundoshi, which is also recommended by doctors, is a good alternative.

Even today, though not commonly, members of the Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. military (including foreigners) reportedly use fundoshi. It’s said that they wear the rokushaku fundoshi to boost morale when needed, and during harsh training where they can’t bathe for days, they use either the rokushaku or Etchū fundoshi. This is because fundoshi allows for changing underwear without removing shoes or pants, making it hygienic and functional. This pragmatic attitude is commendable. However, foreigners, perhaps unaccustomed to exposing their buttocks, seem to prefer the Etchū fundoshi over the rokushaku.
