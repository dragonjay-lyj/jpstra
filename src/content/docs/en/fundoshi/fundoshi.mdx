## The Image and Practicality of Fundoshi

What impression do you get when you hear the word "fundoshi"? "Erotic," "embarrassing," "old-fashioned"—these are undoubtedly the common negative perceptions. However, these are all issues related to its appearance and not a discussion of its functionality as underwear. In fact, the history of Japanese people no longer using fundoshi as underwear is much shorter than the history of its use. We Japanese are accustomed to seeing fundoshi as traditional festival attire or the mawashi worn by sumo wrestlers (a type of six-shaku fundoshi). Once accepted, it should no longer seem like such a peculiar undergarment. The key is that if the number of fundoshi users increases and it regains its status as a mainstream undergarment, it will no longer be viewed with strange eyes. In this sense, fundoshi shares a similar dilemma with the kimono.

However, it is heartening to see that there are now many serious websites on the internet dedicated to fundoshi, showing that there are surprisingly many people interested in it. Even more surprising is that the age group of these people is unexpectedly young, with those in their 20s and 30s forming the core.

The superiority of fundoshi lies above all in its functionality and comfort, and recent medical studies have even begun to prove that it is an excellent undergarment. I have personally used the six-shaku fundoshi as underwear for kimono for many years and deeply believe that fundoshi is perfectly suited for kimono.

I still remember a New Year's Eve in the mid-1970s when NHK's "Year in Review" program mentioned "things that will disappear from Japan by the 21st century," and fundoshi was listed. However, this prediction turned out to be completely wrong. Even today, in the 21st century, there are still many fundoshi enthusiasts. I encourage everyone to try fundoshi out of curiosity and experience its functionality and comfort for themselves.

## The Advantages of Fundoshi

To put it in a somewhat clichéd way, fundoshi can be said to be an undergarment well-suited to Japan's humid climate. However, its functionality and wearing experience truly possess unique advantages that other undergarments cannot match. Since different types of fundoshi have their own distinct features, I would like to explain the two most common and practical types here: the "rokushaku fundoshi" and the "etchū fundoshi."

The common advantages of both as undergarments are that they allow for adjustable tightness according to one's body shape and preferences, and each offers its own unique sense of openness. Wearing breathable undergarments is also beneficial for health. The secret to their breathability lies not only in their shape but also in the fact that they are typically made of bleached cotton (though there are also silk and linen fundoshi). Unlike the cotton used in briefs or trunks, bleached cotton has a smooth texture and becomes softer and more skin-friendly with each wash, making it, in my opinion, the best material for undergarments. This is further proven by the fact that the same bleached cotton is used for baby diapers. I sincerely hope that people will take a serious look at fundoshi and allow more individuals to experience the unique comfort that it offers to men.

## About the Rokushaku Fundoshi

For those who favor the rokushaku fundoshi, its appeal undoubtedly lies in its wearing experience. The snug fit provides an indescribable sense of refreshment and mental focus. The phrase "kinkon ichiban" (literally, "tightening the fundoshi to prepare for action") originates from this very sensation, and this comfort has a profoundly positive impact on one's mental state. Additionally, depending on how tightly it is tied, the horizontal wrapping around the lower abdomen can moderately compress the area, which incidentally improves internal organ function. Another point, though this may be a matter of personal preference, is that the buttocks are almost entirely exposed, and the sense of openness can become addictive once you get used to it. After all, even when sweating, there is no discomfort of fabric clinging to the buttocks, making it highly recommended for those who sit for long periods or struggle with heat rash due to excessive sweating. Moreover, when wearing a silk nagajuban (under-kimono), you can literally feel the smooth texture of silk against your entire buttocks. This level of comfort is truly worth experiencing!

Furthermore, when wearing the rokushaku fundoshi, the horizontal wrapping around the waist and the "mitsu" knot at the back sit just beneath the obi (kimono belt), providing added stability to the belt. For those who only need minor adjustments, using a longer rokushaku to thicken the horizontal wrap can replace the need for a towel, making the belt more secure and the overall wearing experience more comfortable. Even when using the restroom (for bowel movements), there is no need to pull it down like with briefs, and afterward, the obi won’t get in the way or cause the kimono to become disheveled—handling it is far more convenient with a fundoshi.

## About the Length of the Rokushaku Fundoshi

First of all, the "rokushaku" (six shaku) in the term "rokushaku fundoshi" differs from the unit used in architecture and other fields. It is based on the kujirajaku (鯨尺), a traditional Japanese measuring tool used in kimono tailoring (named after the whale baleen historically used to make rulers). Therefore, one rokushaku equals approximately 227 centimeters. However, depending on one’s physique, a slightly longer length may be necessary. For example, when tying an obi (kimono belt) for someone with a waist of about 90 centimeters, a length of around 270 centimeters is typically used. That said, the length and tying method of the fundoshi vary depending on its purpose. In local festivals, an entire tan (about 11 meters) of fabric may be used as-is, but for daily use as underwear, a length of 200 centimeters is often sufficient for practical tying.

The shortest piece of fabric on the far left is about 210 centimeters long. While this depends on body type, a minimum of 200 centimeters is enough to tie a rokushaku fundoshi. I primarily use this length for sleeping under nightwear or during hot summer days. The red fundoshi in the middle is about 270 centimeters long (approximately seven shaku), which is the most common length. This seven-shaku length is also frequently used for festival attire. Incidentally, I don’t usually wear this red fundoshi in daily life—I mostly stick to white. The longest fundoshi on the far right measures about 375 centimeters (approximately ten shaku). This is typically used when I want to wear a kimono more formally than usual. For daily wear, it might be a bit too long.

## The Names of the Parts of the Rokushaku Fundoshi

The cloth hanging down at the front is called the 'maedare' (前垂れ).<br/>
Hidden beneath the maedare, the part of the cloth covering the crotch is called the 'fukuro' (袋).<br/>
The knot where the cloth crosses in a T-shape at the back is called the 'mitsu' (みつ).<br/>
The belt-like part wrapped around the waist is called the 'yokomawashi' (横廻し).<br/>
The vertical part running from the crotch at the back to the 'mitsu' on the back is called the 'tatemawashi' (立て廻し).

# How to Tie a Fundoshi (Rokushaku Fundoshi)

The rokushaku fundoshi is a long piece of cloth wrapped around the waist, and there are actually many ways to tie it. The method introduced here is just one example suitable for everyday wear as an undergarment for kimono, and it differs from the methods used during festivals or swimming, which involve more vigorous movements. (For professional methods used during festivals, please refer to other websites where they are explained in detail). For example, during festivals or for swimming, the fundoshi is tied in a way that ensures it won’t loosen or come off even with intense movement. However, using this method in daily life can make things like using the restroom inconvenient.

My everyday method is similar to the Etchū fundoshi, with a front flap and a single layer (one layer of cloth) in the crotch area. This way, I don’t have to untie the fundoshi every time I use the restroom, and even if I sweat a little, it dries quickly, making it more hygienic.

Additionally, by adjusting the length of the cloth according to body type and preference, even the front-flap style can have the following variations. Try different methods depending on the season, purpose, and personal preference. I usually use the full width of the cloth (the original width of the fabric), but some people cut it vertically to 2/3 or 1/2 width for a narrower strip, so feel free to experiment.

Single front flap, single wrap around the waist (short length rokushaku)……Approximately 6 shaku (227 cm)<br/>
Double front flap, single wrap around the waist (medium length rokushaku)……Approximately 7 shaku (265 cm)<br/>
Single front flap, double wrap around the waist (slightly long rokushaku)……Approximately 8 shaku (302 cm)<br/>
Double front flap, double wrap around the waist (long length rokushaku)……Approximately 10 shaku (378 cm)

Please note that the tying methods introduced here are just examples and not necessarily the most correct ways. However, most fundoshi tying methods are similar up to a certain point, with differences mainly in how the knot is tied and how the excess cloth is handled. Once you get the hang of it, feel free to experiment with your own variations.

One thing to note when wearing a rokushaku fundoshi is that, after years of use, dark marks may appear on both sides of the waist where the wrap-around part presses against the skin, and these marks may not fade. In my case, perhaps because my skin is loose, even after removing the fundoshi, the marked areas remain indented. While these marks don’t cause pain, if you’re particularly concerned, the Etchū fundoshi might be a safer option.

## Materials for Rokushaku Fundoshi (Fabric)

While rokushaku fundoshi can be purchased as ready-made products through online shopping, fundamentally, fundoshi can be made by oneself using fabrics like bleached cotton. Essentially, you just need to prepare a bolt of bleached cotton and cut it to a length that suits your physique. For a rokushaku fundoshi, simply cutting the fabric to length is fine, or you can sew one end for added durability. For an Etchū fundoshi, prepare a piece of fabric around 100 cm long, attach a thick cord to one end, and sew the edge to secure it. The most commonly used fabric is bleached cotton, which can be purchased at kimono shops or department store baby sections for around 800 yen per bolt (approximately 10 meters). During sales, you might find it for as low as 300 yen per bolt.

However, for a rokushaku fundoshi, a cotton fabric called "Moss" (モス) is the best choice. Moss is a type of bleached cotton fabric, typically around 21 meters long and 35 cm wide. It has a tighter weave and finer texture compared to regular bleached cotton, making it ideal for fundoshi, in my opinion. It offers a significantly better fit and feel than regular bleached cotton. The price of a bolt varies by store but generally ranges from 1,500 to 2,500 yen, with white and red being relatively easy to find. Moss comes in about 20 colors, and some stores even offer it by the cut. However, there are many varieties of both bleached cotton and Moss, so it might be hard to find the perfect one on your first try. Since it’s relatively inexpensive, I recommend experimenting with different types. For rokushaku fundoshi, it’s best to choose fabric with "ears" (a finished edge to prevent fraying) on both ends. Additionally, Moss is broadly divided into thick and thin varieties, with the thin ones usually being cheaper and lower quality. Generally, the thick variety is about twice as thick as the thin one (the difference in thickness is noticeable when comparing bolts of the same length).

Among the shops that sell fabric for rokushaku fundoshi, my favorite is "Adachiya," located on Hisago-dori in Asakusa. This store specializes in festival supplies and sells fabric for "shimekomi" (as they call fundoshi here), with dozens of varieties available. The fabric sold at "Adachiya" offers the highest level of comfort and fit, and it’s worth noting that they finish both edges with "ears" to prevent fraying. Without this, the threads tend to unravel after every wash. By the way, most commercially available fabrics have only one "ear" (some have none, so be careful). When buying here, you can confidently say, "Please give me seven shaku of this and ten shaku of that," and they’ll happily cut it for you. If asked, "What is this for?" I simply reply, "For shimekomi" (note: this interaction may not work at other stores!). Additionally, the ready-made Etchū fundoshi sold here is highly regarded for its ease of use.

Another recommended store is "Yuzawaya," near JR Kamata Station, which carries a wide variety of bleached cotton and Moss. They also offer cutting services. If you live in the Tokyo area, it’s worth checking out. Note that both bleached cotton and Moss feel better after being washed and thoroughly kneaded when new. Also, colored Moss like red or navy will inevitably fade, so be cautious. Personally, I mainly use white.

By the way, at general kimono shops or wholesalers, you might need to refer to Moss as "Nice Moss" or "A Nice" for them to understand. Among the commercially available thick Moss, I’ve tried brands like "Diamond Moss" and "Kin Daikoku Moss," and for thin Moss, "Ginban Senkoubai Moss." Of these, "Kin Daikoku Moss" and "Senkoubai Moss" had a decent fit, but "Diamond Moss" felt slightly less comfortable to me. Interestingly, the red "Diamond Moss" felt better than the white.

As for bleached cotton, my favorite brand is "Shirataki Sarashi." It has a pleasant texture, becomes softer with each wash, and enhances the natural feel of cotton. On the other hand, "Chita Yuki Sarashi" remains somewhat stiff even after washing, making it less suitable for fundoshi. However, after more than 20 washes, these fabrics can feel completely different, so it’s hard to generalize. By the way, "Shirataki Sarashi" is mainly available in the Kansai region, while "Chita Yuki Sarashi" is found in the Kanto region. There are likely many other brands nationwide, so it’s best to start with what’s available locally. Personally, I use thin Moss or bleached cotton in the summer and thick Moss in other seasons.

Now, about non-cotton fundoshi, there are also silk versions. Silk is good for the body and offers the best fit, but it’s expensive and hard to come by. Some are made from habutae or rinzu, and there are even fundoshi made from chirimen (see the Etchū fundoshi image at the bottom of this page). For using pure silk fabric as a rokushaku fundoshi, slightly thicker and sturdier material is ideal. Among my collection, I particularly like a silk rokushaku made from nagajuban fabric, which I use occasionally for a change of pace.

The photos above show various fabrics for rokushaku fundoshi. The leftmost photo features all the cotton fabrics I purchased from "Adachiya" in Asakusa for shimekomi. Prices vary by color and pattern, ranging from 80 to 300 yen per shaku. I mainly use the white fabric on the far left, priced at 110 yen per shaku. The center photo shows Moss bolts available at kimono shops. The rightmost photo features two brands of bleached cotton and a piece of pure silk fabric. This silk fabric isn’t specifically for fundoshi, but it’s a great way to experience the feel of silk. It’s a type of lining called "dōura," used for the inner lining of women’s kimonos, and can be purchased for around 3,000 yen per bolt (approximately 8 meters) during department store kimono sales. However, it’s very thin, so I recommend doubling it up, though the fit isn’t great. It might be better used as a thin summer Etchū fundoshi with cords attached.

## Etchū Fundoshi

While I personally prefer to wear rokushaku fundoshi year-round, the rope-attached Etchū fundoshi might be more popular. I usually wear Etchū fundoshi as underwear when sleeping or wearing a samue (work clothes). The appeal of Etchū fundoshi lies in the ability to freely adjust the tightness of the rope and the fact that it doesn’t put pressure on the groin, offering a very relaxed and comfortable fit. For this reason, Etchū fundoshi has gained attention as a stress-free undergarment. There are even stories of people who struggled to conceive for years but succeeded after switching to Etchū fundoshi, or those whose shoulder stiffness was alleviated. Personally, I find that Etchū fundoshi doesn’t give me the same mental sharpness, so I’m more of a rokushaku fundoshi person. However, if you’re hesitant about rokushaku fundoshi, Etchū fundoshi, which is also recommended by doctors, is a great alternative.

Even today, members of the Self-Defense Forces and the U.S. military (including foreigners, of course) are said to use fundoshi, though not as daily wear. It’s reported that they wear rokushaku fundoshi to mentally prepare themselves in critical situations, and during harsh training where they can’t bathe for days, they use either rokushaku or Etchū fundoshi. This is because fundoshi allows for changing undergarments without removing shoes or pants, making it hygienic and functional. It’s commendable how they embrace practical solutions without hesitation. However, it seems that foreigners are hesitant about rokushaku fundoshi, possibly due to their lack of cultural exposure to bare buttocks, and thus they tend to favor Etchū fundoshi.
