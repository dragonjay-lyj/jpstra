## Introduction

The fundoshi is a traditional Japanese undergarment. However, in modern Japan, many people may have only seen it in period dramas or festivals. Just as kimono and traditional Japanese clothing are no longer everyday wear, the fundoshi has been completely pushed out of daily life due to the Westernization policies following the Meiji Restoration.

However, the fundoshi is now being re-evaluated, and its enthusiasts are increasing.

The reason for this is the renewed appreciation for the functionality and aesthetics of the fundoshi.

In other words, the completely different structure, function, and design compared to underwear (note: Western-style underwear) are being perceived as fresh by a generation raised on underwear.

The characteristics of the fundoshi, broadly speaking, are as follows:<br/>
1. It is made from non-stretch materials.<br/>
2. It is made from rectangular fabric.<br/>
3. It can be adjusted and worn according to one's body.<br/>
4. It can be worn not only as underwear but also as formal attire.

Many may have noticed that the first three points above are actually also the differences between Western and Japanese clothing. The fundoshi is a part of the traditional Japanese lifestyle culture of interacting with fabric.

So, what are the advantages of the fundoshi compared to underwear? These are, of course, closely related to the four characteristics mentioned above:<br/>
A. The tightness can be adjusted according to individual body shape, physical condition, and mood at the time.<br/>
B. By adjusting the tightness, breathability and fit can be controlled, adapting to changes in climate, temperature, and humidity.<br/>
C. Using non-stretch fabric can bring a unique sense of openness or tension.<br/>
D. Being worn by 'tying' makes it easier to put on and take off compared to underwear, which must be 'put on.'<br/>
E. One can enjoy a variety of changes in fabric material, color, and pattern.

The above characteristics are again similar to the differences between Japanese and Western clothing. This means that the issues encountered while living with a fundoshi are likely similar to those encountered while wearing kimono.

Issues when living with a fundoshi:<br/>
1. In modern Japan, fundoshi wearers are a minority and may be viewed with curiosity, leading to embarrassment.<br/>
2. It is difficult to obtain, and even if available, it can be expensive.<br/>
3. Many do not know how to wear it, and there are few people around who do.<br/> 
4. Modern life is based on Western clothing, which can lead to some inconveniences.

However, none of these are insurmountable problems.

The reasons for this are the fact that the fundoshi was once a normal part of life for Japanese people, and the modern prevalence of the internet.

And even if you are not Japanese, we guarantee that trying the fundoshi even once will open up a world different from that of underwear.

### ・Rokushaku Fundoshi

When worn, it feels crisp and gives a sense of tension. Most of the fundoshi seen at festivals are the rokushaku fundoshi. There is a bit of a knack to the way it is tied.

### About Rokushaku Fundoshi

The rokushaku fundoshi is the simplest in structure among fundoshi. Essentially, it is just a long piece of cloth.<br/>
As the name suggests, the rokushaku fundoshi is made by wrapping a piece of cloth measuring approximately six shaku (using the kujirajaku scale, where 1 shaku ≈ 37.88 cm) × 6 ≈ 230 cm around the waist.<br/>
There are two ways to tie the rokushaku fundoshi: one method leaves a front flap (hereinafter referred to as the 'front-flap method'), and the other involves passing the front flap through the crotch and securing it at the back (hereinafter referred to as the 'no-front-flap method').<br/>
The front-flap method allows the fundoshi to be easily loosened, making it convenient for activities such as using the restroom.<br/>
The no-front-flap method ensures a firm and secure fit, making it the preferred choice for vigorous activities like festivals.

Rokushaku fundoshi are typically not sold in stores. Generally, one purchases bleached cotton cloth and cuts it to a size suitable for their body.'<br/>
The length should be adjusted according to body size. For the front-flap method, the length should be slightly shorter (about 20 cm) than 'waist circumference × 3,' while for the no-front-flap method, it should be slightly longer than 'waist circumference × 3.'

The main differences between rokushaku fundoshi and Etchu fundoshi are that the former forms a T-back and can be tied more tightly and securely than the latter.<br/>
If Etchu fundoshi can be described as 'loose,' then rokushaku fundoshi can be considered 'tight.' However, the tightness can be adjusted freely, and the exposed buttocks provide a unique wearing sensation not found in other undergarments.

Until the Meiji period, the rokushaku fundoshi was the standard undergarment for Japanese men. In ukiyo-e prints by artists like Katsushika Hokusai and illustrations in humorous books, the undergarments of townspeople were often rokushaku fundoshi.<br/>
However, from the late Edo period, Etchu fundoshi began to gain popularity among doctors, intellectuals, and the elderly, gradually replacing the rokushaku fundoshi.<br/>
Generally speaking, until the Edo period, it can be roughly said that: Etchu fundoshi = loose = undergarment for non-laboring times, Rokushaku fundoshi = tight = undergarment for laboring times.<br/>
Of course, as modern individuals, we can choose based on personal preference. I wear both Etchu and rokushaku fundoshi depending on my mood for the day.

(Note) In the Japanese shakkanhō measurement system, there are primarily two units of length: the kanejaku (曲尺), used mainly in construction, and the kujirajaku (鯨尺), used in tailoring.<br/>
Kanejaku: 1 shaku = 30.3 cm<br/>
Kujirajaku: 1 shaku = 37.88 cm<br/>
There is a significant difference between the two. The kanejaku is the more commonly used unit, but fundoshi are clothing, so the kujirajaku is used.<br/>
The fact that there are two types of \"shaku\" is surprisingly unknown, and examples of incorrect usage can even be found in authoritative texts.
