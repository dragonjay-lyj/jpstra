## Introduction

Fundoshi is a traditional Japanese undergarment. However, in modern Japan, many people may have only seen it in period dramas or festivals. Just as kimono and traditional Japanese clothing are no longer everyday wear, the Westernization policies following the Meiji Restoration pushed fundoshi entirely out of daily life.

Yet, fundoshi is now being reevaluated, and its enthusiasts are growing in number.

The reason for this lies in the renewed appreciation of its functionality and aesthetic value.

In other words, the completely different structure, function, and design of fundoshi compared to underwear (referred to as "pants" below) feel refreshing to a generation raised in a pants-centric culture.

The characteristics of fundoshi that set it apart from pants can be broadly summarized as follows:<br/>
1. It is made from non-stretch materials.<br/>
2. It is based on rectangular pieces of fabric.<br/>
3. It can be adjusted and worn according to one’s body.<br/>
4. It is sometimes worn not just as underwear but also as formal attire.

Many may have noticed that points one to three above are also differences between Western clothing and traditional Japanese clothing. Fundoshi embodies the traditional lifestyle culture of the Japanese people and their relationship with fabric.

So, what are the advantages of fundoshi over pants? These advantages are, of course, closely related to the four characteristics mentioned above.<br/>
A. The tightness can be adjusted according to one’s body shape, physical condition, and mood.<br/>
B. The level of breathability and fit can be controlled by adjusting the tightness, adapting to changes in climate, temperature, and humidity.<br/>
C. The use of non-stretch fabric provides a unique sense of openness or tension.<br/>
D. Being worn by "tying" rather than "pulling on" makes it easier to put on and take off compared to pants.<br/>
E. It allows for enjoyment of the diverse variations in fabric material, color, and pattern.

These characteristics are again similar to the differences between traditional Japanese clothing and Western clothing. This means that the challenges of living in fundoshi are likely similar to those of wearing kimono or traditional Japanese clothing.

Challenges of Living in Fundoshi<br/>
1. In modern Japan, fundoshi wearers are a minority and may be seen as odd, leading to embarrassment.<br/>
2. It is difficult to obtain, and even if available, it can be expensive.<br/>
3. Many do not know how to wear it, and there are few people around who do.<br/> 
4. Modern life is based on Western clothing, which can make fundoshi inconvenient at times.

However, none of these are insurmountable problems.

The reasons are that fundoshi was something Japanese people of the past wore as a matter of course, and the internet is now widely available.

And even if you are not Japanese, we guarantee that trying fundoshi even once will open up a world entirely different from pants.

### ・Rokushaku Fundoshi

The Rokushaku Fundoshi, when tied, gives a sharp and tidy appearance with a sense of tension. Most fundoshi seen at festivals are of the Rokushaku type. However, tying it requires a bit of skill.

### About Rokushaku Fundoshi

The Rokushaku Fundoshi is the simplest in structure among fundoshi. Essentially, it is just a long piece of cloth.<br/>
As the name suggests, the Rokushaku Fundoshi uses a cloth about six shaku (a traditional Japanese unit of measurement, where 1 shaku ≈ 37.88 cm) in length, totaling approximately 230 cm, which is wrapped around the waist.<br/>
There are two main ways to tie the Rokushaku Fundoshi: one method leaves a front flap (referred to as the "front-flap method"), while the other involves passing the front flap through the crotch and securing it at the back (referred to as the "no-front-flap method").<br/>
The front-flap method allows for easy loosening, making it convenient for activities like using the restroom.<br/>
The no-front-flap method provides a firmer and more secure fit, making it the preferred choice for festivals with vigorous physical activities.

Rokushaku Fundoshi are typically not sold in stores. Generally, one purchases bleached cotton fabric and cuts it to a size suitable for their body. For details on purchasing bleached cotton fabric, please refer to the section "Buying Fundoshi."<br/>
The length should be adjusted according to one's physique. For the front-flap method, the cloth should be slightly shorter (about 20 cm) than three times the waist circumference, while for the no-front-flap method, it should be slightly longer than three times the waist circumference.'

The key differences between Rokushaku Fundoshi and Etchu Fundoshi are that the former results in a T-back style and can be tied more tightly and securely.<br/>
If Etchu Fundoshi can be described as "loose," then Rokushaku Fundoshi could be considered "tight." However, the tightness can be adjusted freely, and the exposed buttocks provide a unique wearing experience that other undergarments cannot offer.

Until the Meiji period, Rokushaku Fundoshi was the standard undergarment for Japanese men. In ukiyo-e prints and illustrations from shunga books, such as those by Katsushika Hokusai, the undergarments worn by townspeople were mostly Rokushaku Fundoshi.<br/>
However, from the late Edo period, Etchu Fundoshi began to gain popularity among doctors, intellectuals, and the elderly, gradually replacing Rokushaku Fundoshi.<br/>
Generally speaking, until the Edo period, it could be roughly summarized as:<br/>
Etchu Fundoshi = loose = undergarment for non-labor activities<br/>
Rokushaku Fundoshi = tight = undergarment for labor activities<br/>
Of course, as modern individuals, we are free to choose based on personal preference. I tie both Etchu and Rokushaku Fundoshi depending on my mood for the day.

### How to Tie a Rokushaku Fundoshi

Method Without a Front Apron<br/>
The first half of the process is the same as the method with a front apron.

Note: In Japan’s traditional measurement system, there are two main units of length: the kanejaku (曲尺), primarily used in construction, and the kujirajaku (鯨尺), used in tailoring.<br/>
Kanejaku: 1 shaku = 30.3 cm<br/>
Kujirajaku: 1 shaku = 37.88 cm<br/>
There is a significant difference between the two. While the kanejaku is the more commonly used unit, the fundoshi is a garment, so the kujirajaku is used.<br/>
The fact that there are two types of “shaku” is surprisingly little known, and there are examples of incorrect usage even in published works.
