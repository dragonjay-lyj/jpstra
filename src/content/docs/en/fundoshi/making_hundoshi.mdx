## Sewing a Fundoshi

### How to Make a Rokushaku Fundoshi

The Rokushaku Fundoshi is made simply by cutting the purchased fabric. Bleached cotton is commonly used, but there is also a type of cotton called "Watanmos" or "Shinmos" (see note below), which has a softer texture. <br/>
A bolt of fabric is approximately 10 meters long, so one bolt can make four Rokushaku Fundoshi.<br/>
I usually leave the cut edges as they are. Initially, there may be some fraying, but it settles down with use.<br/>
If the edges bother you, you can fold them in and sew them.

Additionally, I use the full width of the fabric (full width). However, if you want a narrower width, you will need to reduce the width, which is a bit more labor-intensive.<br/>
The bleached cotton fabric, as purchased, has anti-fraying treatment applied to both ends.

If you reduce the width of the fabric, significant fraying will occur along the length, making it look a bit unsightly.<br/>
Therefore, you must fold and sew the edges. Since the fabric is around 2 meters long, hand-sewing can be tiring, and there may be issues with strength, so using a sewing machine is recommended.
