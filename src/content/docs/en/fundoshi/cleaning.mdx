I usually wash my fundoshi by placing it in a laundry net and then putting it in the washing machine.<br/>
For longer fundoshi like the rokusaku fundoshi, or those with strings such as the Etchū and Mokko fundoshi, not using a laundry net can cause them to tangle with other laundry.

For areas with heavy stains, it’s a good idea to do a pre-wash using a washboard.<br/>
You don’t need the large washboard that mothers used to use with a tub. A small one for spot cleaning is sufficient.

When using the washing machine, be mindful of color bleeding. Patterned fundoshi may bleed, and if the color transfers to other laundry, it can be difficult to remove.<br/>
Fundoshi that you’ve dyed yourself will also inevitably bleed, so wash them separately until the color stabilizes.

Some people insist on hand-washing. In this case, a larger washboard might be necessary.

There are also those who take their fundoshi into the bath with them. During bathing, they use the fundoshi like a towel to wash their bodies.<br/>
This way, you can wash both yourself and the fundoshi at the same time—killing two birds with one stone—and it also deepens your attachment to it.
