The term "fundoshi" seems to have become widespread during the Edo period. Prior to that, it was often referred to as "tafusagi," and in ancient texts, "tafusagi" was written with the Chinese characters "犢鼻褌" (dú bí kūn).<br/>
There are various theories about the etymology of "fundoshi." Since I lack the ability to delve deeply into this topic, I will simply list the explanations found in various dictionaries and literature.

## The Etymology of Fundoshi

The theory that "fundoshi" is derived from the word "fumitōshi" (踏み通し) through phonetic change.<br/>
The theory that "fundoshi" is derived from "fumodashi" (踏紐), a cord used to tie horses or dogs, through phonetic change.<br/>
The theory that "fundoshi" originates from Korean, based on the pronunciation of "褌衣" as "hun-t-os" in Korean.<br/>
The theory that "fundoshi" is related to "hodo" (ほど, meaning genital area), evolving first into "hodoshi" and then transforming into "fundoshi" through phonetic shift.<br/>
The theory that "fundoshi" comes from "糞土止" (literally "stopping feces and dirt").

The first and second theories are the ones commonly adopted in general dictionaries. As for the third theory, some argue that there is no such word as "フントス" in Korean, so its validity remains unclear.<br/>
If anyone knowledgeable about Korean could provide insight, it would be greatly appreciated. As for the fifth theory, it’s probably more of a playful pun than a serious explanation.

## The Etymology of Tokubikon

The character "犢" in "犢鼻褌 (tokubikon)" means "calf." The name is said to originate from the resemblance of the bulge in the groin area when wearing a fundoshi to the nose of a calf.<br/>
The term "犢鼻褌," which was introduced from China, was matched by the Japanese with the native word "たふさぎ (tafusagi)." The details of "たふさぎ" will be discussed later.

## About the Character "褌"

So, what is the original meaning of the character "褌" in "犢鼻褌"? "軍" is an ideogram that represents the state of being encircled by vehicles. From this, the character "軍" has two derived meanings: one is "fortress," "army," or "soldiers," and the other is "to encircle" or "to become round." For example, in "運 (transport, encircle)" and "渾 (round mass)," the latter meaning is used. The character "褌" is written with the "衣" radical and "軍," but it does not refer to the military meaning; instead, it signifies wrapping or encircling with cloth.

## The Etymology of "たふさぎ"

"たふさぎ" is another name for the loincloth known as "褌." There are several theories about the etymology of "たふさぎ":

It originated from the act of covering the genital area with one's hand, hence "手塞ぎ" (hand covering), which later transformed into "たふさぎ."<br/>
It is a shortened form of "股ふさぎ" (thigh covering).<br/>
It is a shortened form of "処ふさぎ" (area covering).<br/>
It derives from "太布（たふ）下げ" (hanging down "たふ" cloth), which became "たふさぎ" over time. "たふ" refers to an ancient type of cloth made from tree bark.<br/>
It comes from "太布裂き" (tearing "たふ" cloth), as the cloth was torn for use.

## The Etymology of "越中褌"

"越中" refers to the area around present-day Toyama Prefecture, but it does not seem to be the birthplace of the "越中褌" (Echū fundoshi). There are several theories about its origin:

During the Enpō era of the Edo period, a courtesan named "越中" tore her own crepe waistcloth to make a fundoshi for her customer, thus giving it the name.<br/>
It is said that Echū-no-kami Akimoto, a feudal lord of Kōzuke Province (present-day Gunma Prefecture), had workers engaged in the Tone River construction project wear it, marking its beginning.<br/>
During the Tenmei and Kansei eras, Echū-no-kami Matsudaira promoted the use of the "越中褌" as a more fabric-efficient alternative to the "六尺褌" (rokushaku fundoshi) to encourage frugality, thus leading to its name.
