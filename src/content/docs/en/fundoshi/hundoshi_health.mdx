In recent years, Etchu fundoshi have become increasingly visible in regular underwear sections of stores. Most of them are priced between 1,000 and 2,000 yen, and many are well-stitched, which is a welcome development.<br/>
This seems to be part of the trend driven by the government-recommended “Cool Biz” campaign. Compared to regular underwear, Etchu fundoshi are cooler to wear in the summer, making them a popular choice.

## Sperm Production

The claim that Etchu fundoshi are cooler than regular underwear is largely accurate.<br/>
The tightness of the Etchu fundoshi can be adjusted to be as loose as desired, making it highly breathable.<br/>
Additionally, unlike regular underwear, Etchu fundoshi can be made from cool materials like hemp, hemp blends, or kōbai (see note below), offering an even more refreshing feel against the skin.

For men, the coolness of the groin area is actually medically significant.<br/>
The male testes (commonly known as "balls") are positioned outside the body.<br/>
The scrotum (commonly known as the "sack") is covered with numerous wrinkles and reacts sensitively to external temperatures, expanding and contracting accordingly.<br/>
In cold or tense situations, it shrinks, while in warm or relaxed states, it hangs loosely.<br/>
This is because the function of the testes, the organs responsible for sperm production, is closely linked to temperature and the autonomic nervous system. Medical studies have shown that testes naturally maintain a temperature about 2 degrees lower than body temperature, which is optimal for sperm production.<br/>
Wearing regular underwear, however, forces the testes to remain pressed against the body regardless of the environment, which is highly inconvenient for them.

Thus, fundoshi can be considered a more physiologically natural undergarment than regular underwear.<br/>
While it’s not directly tied to the government’s "Cool Biz" campaign, starting with "Etchu fundoshi in the summer" might not be a bad idea.

There are stories of men conceiving children shortly after starting to wear fundoshi.<br/>
This could be attributed to the enhanced sperm production function mentioned above, but there may also be a psychological aspect.<br/>
In other words, fundoshi can serve as a tool for Japanese men to express their "masculinity."<br/>
This is not strange at all. "Identity" is deeply rooted in a nation’s historical and cultural traditions.<br/>
Therefore, even if one feels indifferent seeing themselves in briefs or boxers, finding themselves "cool" in fundoshi is perfectly natural.

(Note) Kōbai: A fabric woven using two or more threads of varying thicknesses, creating a waffle-like texture on the surface. The thinner threads enhance breathability, providing a cool and comfortable feel.

## Allergies

Among allergies, those caused by skin contact with substances are called contact allergies. Allergies are a modern ailment that has become increasingly severe with the development of modern civilization.<br/>
Put simply, the advancement of modern civilization has surrounded us with materials that did not exist in the world before the rise of modern industry. In such an environment, it is only natural that our bodies react abnormally.

I am not here to deny modern civilization. When it comes to clothing, as someone who sweats easily, I have benefited from the high-performance synthetic fibers developed in recent years. Moreover, the fact that my writings reach readers is thanks to the widespread use of computers and the internet.<br/>
However, for those who are genuinely suffering, it is a different story.

For people suffering from allergies, immune disorders, or other abnormal bodily reactions, it is only natural to try to make their environment more natural.<br/>
One woman, troubled by atopic dermatitis, abandoned Western clothing and switched to a lifestyle of fundoshi (traditional Japanese loincloth) and kimono.<br/>
By choosing this lifestyle, she was able to break free from modern materials. So-called underwear, briefs, or regular Western clothing often use synthetic fibers, synthetic rubber, plastics, or metals. By completely overhauling her lifestyle, she was liberated from the constant anxiety caused by these materials.

Of course, maintaining such a lifestyle requires a certain level of learning and adaptation. However, this was something that almost all Japanese people did not too long ago.<br/>
If one chooses fundoshi as underwear, the range of available fabrics is virtually limitless. Silk, hemp, cotton, synthetic fibers—even silk comes in a variety of techniques, from plain weave to crepe and tsumugi. By literally feeling Japan’s exquisite traditional craftsmanship on one’s skin, it can be harnessed for health benefits.
