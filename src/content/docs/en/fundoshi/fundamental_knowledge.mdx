## How to Purchase a Rokushaku Fundoshi

### Purchasing Methods

Rokushaku fundoshi are generally not available at department stores or kimono shops. Therefore, you will need to purchase them through online retailers. While there are countless online stores selling Rokushaku fundoshi, here are two representative vendors.

Fundoshiya (External Link): Based in Kyoto, this is a long-established online retailer of fundoshi. Their products are highly praised for their quality, but delivery times are said to be somewhat slow.

Kyushuya (External Link): Based in the northern Kyushu region, this is another major retailer. Their products are of good quality, and delivery is very fast. Additionally, since they operate on Rakuten, credit card payments are accepted.

Both vendors offer not only the standard bleached cotton fabric but also a wide variety of colors and patterns. They also accommodate custom sizing requests. Prices start from around 1,000 yen per piece. Furthermore, both vendors take care to avoid labeling the product as "fundoshi" on the packaging, demonstrating their attention to detail.

When choosing between the two vendors, I personally think of it as deciding between "standing in line at a top-tier ramen shop with the best flavor" or "going to a ramen shop that might not be the best but doesn’t require waiting." Ultimately, it’s a matter of preference. For the record, I’m impatient, so I lean toward the latter.

### DIY Method

However, when it comes to Rokushaku fundoshi, you don’t necessarily need to buy pre-made ones. Making them yourself can be significantly cheaper. For the standard white version, all you need is a narrow-width cotton fabric called “sarashi,” which you can purchase and cut to size. Sarashi is available at kimono shops, baby sections of supermarkets (where it’s sold as fabric for baby diapers), and surprisingly, even at pharmacies. Of course, it can also be purchased online. The price is around 1,000 yen per tan (approximately 10 meters).

By dividing the fabric into four equal parts of 2.5 meters each, you can make four fundoshi from one tan, with each one costing about 250 yen. By the way, 2.5 meters is just the right length for an average-sized adult. For those with a larger build, dividing the fabric into three parts of about 3.3 meters each should provide sufficient length. Any excess can be cut off. The width can be adjusted to your preference—full width, 2/3 width, or half width. Full width refers to the entire width of the narrow fabric (such as sarashi), which is about 34 cm for sarashi. 2/3 width is about 34 cm × 2/3 ≈ 22.5 cm, and half width is about 34 cm × 1/2 ≈ 17 cm. Personally, I recommend full width or 2/3 width. To reduce the width, cut the fabric to 2/3 or half width. The easiest way to cut it is to make a small incision at the edge and tear it apart. If this method seems too rough, you can carefully cut it with scissors. If you’re not good with scissors, you might want to try a rotary cutter (external link). By the way, if you divide the fabric into four parts and use half width, you can make eight fundoshi from one tan of sarashi, with each one costing about 125 yen.

When you cut the fabric, the threads may fray during washing, but they will stop fraying after a certain point. If you’re worried about the frayed threads tangling with other laundry, it’s a good idea to wash the fabric in a laundry net.

For colored and patterned fabrics, the details are as follows: Colored fundoshi are typically made using a narrow-width cotton fabric called “Shin-Mosu.” This fabric is finer than sarashi and can be found at kimono shops or large fabric specialty stores (such as Yuzawaya in Tokyo). It’s also available online. The full width of Shin-Mosu is wider than sarashi, at about 36 cm. It is often sold in units of one hiki (equivalent to two tan), but some stores may offer it by the meter. The price is around 3,000 to 4,000 yen per hiki, and it comes in over ten colors, including classic red. It’s worth noting that while Shin-Mosu is often dyed in Kyoto, the raw fabric may be made in China, so finding purely Japanese-made Shin-Mosu might be surprisingly difficult.

Also, Shin-Mosu tends to bleed color significantly when new, so it’s best not to wash it with other items.

For patterned fabrics, you can purchase tenugui fabric at festival用品 shops and have it cut to the desired length. There are various patterns available, so you can choose one that suits your taste.

As a side note, the standard length for a Rokushaku fundoshi is 1.5 times the span of your outstretched arms. This might be a useful reference if you’re making one for a child.

## How to Tie a Rokushaku Fundoshi

Here, we will explain how to tie a Rokushaku fundoshi specifically designed for swimming, known as “Suikosh.” Note that while the illustration uses a red fundoshi, the method is the same for a white one.
