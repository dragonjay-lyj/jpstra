## How to Purchase a Rokushaku Fundoshi

### Purchasing Methods

Rokushaku fundoshi are generally not sold in department stores or kimono shops. Therefore, you will need to purchase them through online retailers. While there are countless online stores selling rokushaku fundoshi, here we introduce two representative companies.

Fundoshi-ya (External Link): Based in Kyoto, this is a long-established online retailer of fundoshi. Their products are highly regarded for their quality, though delivery times tend to be longer.

Kyushu-ya (External Link): Based in the northern Kyushu region, this is another major retailer. The quality is good, and delivery is very fast. Additionally, since it’s a Rakuten shop, you can use credit cards for payment.

Both retailers offer not only the standard bleached fabric but also a wide variety of colors and patterns, and they accommodate detailed size customization. Prices start from around 1,000 yen per piece. Furthermore, both retailers ship items without labeling them as “fundoshi” on the package, showing thoughtful consideration.

As for which retailer to choose, personally, I think it’s like deciding whether to “wait in line at a top-tier ramen shop” or “go to a ramen shop where you don’t have to wait, even if it might not be the absolute best.” It ultimately comes down to personal preference. For the record, I’m an impatient person, so I lean toward the latter.

### DIY Method

However, when it comes to rokushaku fundoshi, you don’t necessarily need to buy ready-made ones. Making them yourself is significantly cheaper. For the standard white version, you can simply purchase a narrow-width cotton fabric called 'sarashi' (bleached cloth), cut it, and make it yourself. Sarashi can be found at kimono shops, supermarket baby sections (sold as fabric for baby diapers), and surprisingly, even at drugstores. Of course, it’s also available through online retailers. The price is around 1,000 yen for 1 tan (approximately 10 meters).

If you divide this into 4 equal parts of 2.5 meters each, you can make 4 fundoshi from 1 tan, costing about 250 yen per piece. By the way, 2.5 meters is just the right length for an average-sized adult. For those with a larger build, dividing it into 3 parts of about 3.3 meters each should provide sufficient length. Any excess can simply be cut off. The width can be adjusted to your preference: full width, 2/3 width, or half width. Full width refers to the entire width of the narrow fabric (like sarashi), which is about 34 cm for sarashi. 2/3 width is about 34 cm × 2/3 ≈ 22.5 cm, and half width is about 34 cm × 1/2 ≈ 17 cm. Personally, I recommend full width or 2/3 width. To reduce the width, cut the fabric to 2/3 or half width. To do this, make a small cut at the edge and tear it apart—it’s easy to split this way. If this method seems too rough, you can carefully cut it with scissors. If you’re not comfortable with scissors, you might want to try a rotary cutter (external link). By the way, if you divide the fabric into 4 parts and use half width, you can make 8 fundoshi from 1 tan of sarashi, costing about 125 yen per piece.

When you cut the fabric, threads may fray during washing, but they will stop fraying after a certain point. If you’re worried about loose threads tangling with other laundry, it’s best to wash the fabric in a laundry net.

As for colored and patterned versions, here’s how to make them: Colored fundoshi are typically made using a narrow-width cotton fabric called 'Shinmosu.' This is a finer cotton fabric than sarashi and can be found at kimono shops or large fabric stores (like Yuzawaya in Tokyo). It’s also available online. The full width of Shinmosu is wider than sarashi, about 36 cm. It’s often sold in units of 1 hiki (equivalent to 2 tan), though some stores may offer it by the cut. The price is around 3,000 to 4,000 yen per hiki, with colors ranging from classic red to over 10 variations. Note that Shinmosu is often dyed in Kyoto, but the raw fabric may be made in China, so finding purely Japanese-made Shinmosu might be surprisingly difficult.

Also, Shinmosu tends to bleed color significantly when new, so avoid washing it with other items.

Patterned fundoshi can be made by purchasing tenugui (hand towel) fabric at festival supply shops and cutting it to the desired length. There are various patterns available, so choose one that suits your taste.

As a side note, the standard length for a rokushaku fundoshi is 1.5 times the span of your outstretched arms. This might be a useful reference if you’re making one for a child.

## How to Tie a Rokushaku Fundoshi

Here, we will explain how to tie a rokushaku fundoshi, specifically the type called 'suikon' (water fundoshi), which is used for swimming. Note that although the illustration shows a red fundoshi, the method is the same for a white one.
